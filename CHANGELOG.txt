Date:   Wed Apr 22 14:44:21 2015 +0300

    Implemented the return REQ/REP channel for testing the sending
    of commands to Mt4 from OTZmqRequest.py. It's not wired up
    to ProcessCmd yet - which is next to do..
    
    That's the good news; the bad news is that it's crashing Mt4.

commit 14ad3e32bf18c46ec5ffb18d27f14d25a7b17166
Date:   Thu Apr 2 04:57:03 2015 +0300

    Made a few minor patches to the src based on the changes in py27-dll-source.zip
    from a forum thread entitled "embedding python"  started by Bernd Kreuss (7bit)
    in a post by Markft
    http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=190534
    
    We bumped the version numbers and didn't incorporate all of the changes;
    the only one of possible significance that we did NOT incorporate was
    <UseAnsiStrings Value="False"/>
    in the SyntaxOptions - python 2 is ANSI strings, but this is proabably just
    a Lazarus GUI setting.

Date:   Thu Apr 2 04:17:19 2015 +0300

    Made purely syntatic changes in the src file of
    py26 -> py27 and Python-2.6 -> Python 2.7

commit 56920b1ccfab0f0406e838bfa46ed175193027b6
Date:   Thu Apr 2 04:01:15 2015 +0300

    We renamed the src files to py27.* and now drop support for Python 2.6.
    
    THESE ARE NOT THE FILES USED TO BUILD THE DLL.
    
    Then we will update them with the files used to generate the py27.dll

commit 9b1429125eaeee9cea17de9ebf38b10f6ffe7a3b
Date:   Thu Apr 2 03:53:47 2015 +0300

    We've checked in the original files from Bernd Kreuss
    http://sites.google.com/site/prof7bit/metatrader-python-integration/py26-dll-source.rar
    
    THESE ARE NOT THE FILES USED TO BUILD THE DLL.
    
    They're checked in for historical purposes, and we will rename them
    to py27.* and drop support for Python 2.6.
    
    Then we will update them with the files used to generate the py27.dll
