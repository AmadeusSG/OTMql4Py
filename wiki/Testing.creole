== Testing ==

There are some initial tests in the file
{{{MQL4/Scripts/OTMql4/OTMql4PyTest.mq4}}}
Attach this script to a chart and it will run a series of simple tests;
you can choose which tests to run as inputs when you attach the script.
Look at the Experts log window for messages; errors will start with the
word {{{ERROR:}}} and should pop up a MessageBox.


=== Known Issues ===

During testing, we have noticed an error when you are repeatedly
initilizing and uninitializing the Python interpreter. Any call of
Python generates a {{{exceptions.SystemError}}}. You must restart
Metatrader if this happens.
