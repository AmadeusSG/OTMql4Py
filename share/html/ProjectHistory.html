<p>OTMql4Py has some changes to how the compiled dll code is used,<br />
and includes a Python file <tt>OTMql427.py</tt> with extra functionality.</p>

<h3>Unicode Functions</h3>

<p>Build 600 of Metatrader4 changed the definition of the fundamental datatype<br />
<tt>string</tt> from being ASCII to being Unicode, and broke every compiled<br />
library called by Mt4 that sent or received a string. The basic change<br />
with implemented as a minor patch release rolled out on live systems.</p>

<p>Metaquotes should have left the existing string definition to be<br />
ASCII, and introduced a new <tt>unicode</tt> datatype, along with Unicode<br />
aware functions, usually with the same function name, but with a<br />
<tt>W</tt> appended, like Windows does. You can still use ASCII strings<br />
in Metatrader4 &gt;600: they are simply arrays of <tt>uchar</tt>, and there<br />
are conversion functions such as <tt>StringToCharArray</tt>.</p></body>
