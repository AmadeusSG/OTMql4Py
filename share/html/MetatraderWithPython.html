<!-- <h1>Metatrader With Python</h1> -->
<p>Metatrader has been a great international success, putting into the<br />
hands of end-users the ability to do programmed trading, something<br />
that was only previously available to large trading houses. It has<br />
been widely adopted, provides a credible platform for Forex trading,<br />
and there are a huge number of "experts" and programs that have been<br />
developed for it.</p>

<p>However, Metatrader as a language is not without some significant<br />
drawbacks. The language is very rudimentary from the computer science<br />
point of view, and is a closed sole-source product. Very importantly<br />
for writing robust, well-tested and easily maintained code, it lacks<br />
proper error handling flow-of-control constructs, such as are found in<br />
Java, Python or Lisp. This leads to poor quality code, as can be seen<br />
by much of the MQL code in existence, including the code from the<br />
manufacturer, MetaQuotes. The poor nature of the language combines<br />
with the very poor coding practices of the community (e.g. not<br />
checking error codes and no documentation or testing) to create a very<br />
poor programming environment.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Metatrader can be extended by writing C-coded function<br />
libraries that are called from MQL. These are usually simple C-coded<br />
function calls, but it opens the possibility of calling any C-coded<br />
interpreted program, including an interpreted language such as<br />
Python. This is a very good solution to extending Metatrader, as<br />
Python is the premiere language for scientific computation, and is<br />
being very rapidly adopted by the financial community (Quants). Python<br />
has an excellent programing culture of unit and functional testing,<br />
and is state-of-the-art in computer science.</p>

<p>The aim of the OTMql4Py is to develop a bridge to Python that can be<br />
called from Metatrader, under Windows and Linux. This allows<br />
Metatrader to be used as a front-end, receiving market data and<br />
executing orders, but with all the important algorithmic work,<br />
database access or user-interface extensions done in Python. This<br />
allows for the important algorithmic code to be subjected to much more<br />
rigorous testing, and makes it much easier to maintain. The bridge can<br />
be also used to feed standard high-speed financial message buses to<br />
distributed applications (e.g. FITS or ZeroMq): see our OTMlq4Zmq<br />
project at <a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq</a> and its usage by<br />
