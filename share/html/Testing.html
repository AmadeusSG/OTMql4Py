<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>There are some initial tests in the file<br />
<tt>MQL4/Scripts/OTMql4/OTMql4PyTest.mq4</tt><br />
Attach this script to a chart and it will run a series of simple tests;<br />
you can choose which tests to run as inputs when you attach the script.<br />
Look at the Experts log window for messages; errors will start with the<br />
word <tt>ERROR:</tt> and should pop up a MessageBox.</p>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<p>During testing, we have noticed an error when you are repeatedly<br />
initilizing and uninitializing the Python interpreter. Any call of<br />
Python generates a <tt>exceptions.SystemError</tt>. You must restart<br />
Metatrader if this happens.</p></body>
