<!-- <h1>Python32Or64Bit</h1> -->
<p>Metatrader is a 32bit executable, and our Python will be running under it,<br />
so it needs 32bit libraries to load, especially the <tt>python27.dll</tt>.<br />
The easiest, and in our opinion the only thing to do, is to install<br />
a 32 Python distribution on your 64bit machine. It runs fine, and although<br />
it may run a lttle slower, it avoids nightmares.</p>

<p>You <strong>could</strong> install OPMql4Py on a machine with a 64 bit Python installed,<br />
if you put a <tt>python27.dll</tt> alongside the Mt4 <tt>terminal.exe</tt><br />
in the <tt>Metatrader</tt> directory of <tt>c:\Program Files</tt>.<br />
Not just in {{{MQL4\Libraries} - it won't work.<br />
Not in {{{SystemWOW64} either - it won't work. OPMql4Py will run,<br />
but you are likely to run into trouble if the Python then calls any<br />
64bit executable code (DLL or PYD) in your Python library code.<br />
So for now, we expect that you are installing OPMql4Py for a 32bit Python,<br />
even on 64bit machines.</p></body>
